## Gentle Trust Bot

This is a lightweight research crawler designed to gather publicly available news articles for analysis related to civic transparency and journalistic quality.

### Principles

- 🕊️ **Respectful Crawling**  
  This bot strictly respects `robots.txt` directives and implements conservative rate limits to avoid placing unnecessary load on source websites.

- 🔎 **Public Content Only**  
  The crawler accesses only publicly available articles and does not attempt to bypass paywalls, authentication, or private content.  We aint got time for that!

- 🧪 **For Research Purposes**  
  The project is part of ongoing experiments in claim extraction, rhetorical framing, and media trust metrics. It is currently non-commercial and exploratory in nature, but we may need to find methods of sustainability in the future to keep it going.

 🤝 **Supporting Journalism**  
  We’re worried about the future of journalism. It’s a profession that matters—and it’s under strain. We want to do our part to protect it, and we hope to see publishers remain strong, trusted, and thriving.
  
- 🔐 **Ethical Considerations**  
  If you represent a publisher or content creator and would like to opt out of analysis, we are happy to accommodate your preferences.

### Status

This project is currently in early development and operates under a low volume, civically-minded protocol. For questions or concerns, please contact the maintainer.
